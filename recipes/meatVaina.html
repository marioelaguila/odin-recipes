    <h1>Delicius Meat!!</h1>
    <img src="carne.jpg" alt="Meat">

    <p>Lean meat is characterized by the absence of cartilage, veins, and, above all, fatty tissue; that is, it is mainly composed of muscle fibers. This type of meat (which can come from poultry, fish, cattle, pigs, lambs, or rabbits) provides more high-quality proteins, vitamin B12, and iron.</p>
